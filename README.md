# Mlflow
I cretaed a Ubuntu 20.04 Virtual machine on Azure portal installed docker, minikube, kubectl. Opened required ports and then created a Git repository which has dockerfile which creates docker image of Mlflow tracking server including a folder with postgres, minio and deployment yaml files which does the job respective to their file names. I could run the services but couldn't response to the services for postgres and minio whereas mlflow container isn't running due to docker permission denied or it says image doesn't exist it couldn't retrive from docker hub https://hub.docker.com/layers/mlflow2021/mlflow/. But I could see the docker image running, I got stuck with compatible issues with Ubuntu 18.04 and installing minikube and few more so it took lot of time to resolve errors.
